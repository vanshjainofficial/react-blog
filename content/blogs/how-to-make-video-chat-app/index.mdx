Ever wondered how apps like Zoom or Google Meet work behind the scenes?

In this post, I’ll break down how I built a **real-time 1:1 video chatting app** using **WebRTC**, **Socket.IO**, and **Express.js** — with features like **video/audio mute, live chat, screen sharing, and instant room codes**.

It’s 100% open-source.

## 🚀 What Does This App Do?

This is not just a basic WebRTC demo — it’s a fully working progressive web app with:

✅ 1-on-1 video calling  
🎤 Toggle mic and camera in-call  
💬 Real-time chat (with notifications!)  
📺 Screen sharing with a single click  
📱 Install as a PWA (Progressive Web App)  
🔗 Share room codes instantly on WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.  
🕒 No time limits or restrictions  
🔐 No login needed, privacy-focused

## 🔧 Core Tech Stack

| Layer | Tech |
|------|------|
| Frontend | React.js, WebRTC, HTML5 |
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| Real-Time | Socket.IO |
| Deployment | Vercel / Render / Railway |
| Dev Tools | Nodemon, Serve |

## 🧱 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1. 🎯 What is WebRTC?

> WebRTC = Web Real-Time Communication  
It allows **peer-to-peer** media streaming directly between browsers without needing to route video/audio through a central server.

That means: lower latency, higher privacy, and free usage.

But WebRTC still needs **signaling** to coordinate the connection — and that’s where **Socket.IO** comes in.

### 2. ⚙️ Backend Setup

The backend is kept minimal — it only handles signaling and messaging. Here's what it does:

✅ Create socket connection  
✅ Emit events like `incomingCall`, `answerCall`, `mediaStatusChanged`, `callTerminated`  
✅ Enable CORS for frontend communication  
✅ No database needed — everything is real-time and ephemeral

```js
// server/index.js
const express = require("express");
const http = require("http");
const socketIO = require("socket.io");

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIO(server, {
  cors: { origin: "*", methods: ["GET", "POST"] },
});

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  socket.emit("socketId", socket.id);

  socket.on("initiateCall", ({ targetId, signalData, senderId, senderName }) => {
    io.to(targetId).emit("incomingCall", { signal: signalData, from: senderId, name: senderName });
  });

  socket.on("answerCall", (data) => {
    io.to(data.to).emit("callAnswered", data);
  });

  socket.on("changeMediaStatus", ({ mediaType, isActive }) => {
    socket.broadcast.emit("mediaStatusChanged", { mediaType, isActive });
  });

  socket.on("sendMessage", ({ targetId, message, senderName }) => {
    io.to(targetId).emit("receiveMessage", { message, senderName });
  });

  socket.on("terminateCall", ({ targetId }) => {
    io.to(targetId).emit("callTerminated");
  });
});

server.listen(5002, () => console.log("Server is running on port 5002"));
